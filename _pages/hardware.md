If you are interested in adding support for a new board, we have a
[guide to porting](https://github.com/tock/tock/blob/master/doc/Porting.md).
While there are a set of minimum requirements to merge a new board
([gpio, timer, uart](https://github.com/tock/tock/blob/master/doc/Porting.md#adding-a-platform-to-tock-repository)),
please feel free [to reach out](https://www.tockos.org/community/)
earlier in the process with draft PRs, issues, questions, etc as you are
getting started!

# Stable

These are the most mature boards in Tock, which have a large number of
peripherals implemented and have generally seen a reasonable amount of testing
and use by the community.

## nRF52 Family

An enhancement of the highly popular nRF51XXX family, Nordic Semiconductor
recently released the nRF52 family of SoCs. These boards include Bluetooth 5,
Bluetooth mesh, NFC, and ANT. The first was the nRF52832, which is available on
the [nRF52 DK][nrf52832]. More recently, they released the nRF52840, which adds
802.15.4 and in turn Thread and Zigbee support, which is available on the
[nRF52840 DK][nrf52840]. This is also available in a minimalist form factor
(no debugging, pin headers, etc) as the [nRF52840 Dongle][nrf52840-dongle].

## Hail & imix

Hail and imix were the first two platforms supported by Tock. They were
designed as a common basis for Tock development.  They have specific features
that make Tock development easier: e.g. a common set of sensors, radios, and
the ability to measure power draw easily. Both Hail and imix were designed at
Universities for our own purposes, but we're able to make them available with
small-run productions funded with grad student rent money. This means they're
not as cheap as they could be. Sorry!

### [Hail](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/boards/hail)

Hail is a Particle Photon sized development board for Tock. You can learn more
on the [introducing hail](../blog/2017/introducing-hail/) post, or buy one
below.

{% include hail_buy.html %}

### [imix](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/boards/imix)

![Imix on a table](/assets/img/imix-v2.1.png)

imix is a "kitchen sink" development board for Tock with a SAM4L MCU, two
wireless radios, a hardware random number generator, and a sensor suite.
See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/helena-project/imix) for more
information.

imix will be available in the coming weeks. Sign up below to be notified by e-mail
when it is available for purchase or contact [Amit](mailto:amit@amitlevy.com) if you
want one sooner.

# Experimental

These are special cases, boards that Tock is experimenting with or hardware
platforms that may not yet themselves be stable or mature.

## [SiFive HiFive1](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/boards/hifive1)

Some of the first commercially available Risc-V hardware, the HiFive1 platform
is iterating quickly. Tock is very interested in Risc-V support and is working
with various platform vendors to quickly iterate on designs for deeply embedded
platforms.

__Where to get it:__ [Crowdsupply][hifive1-revB-hw]*

_*Note: Initial Tock support is for the RevA board which is no longer avaiable,
this now links to the RevB board._

[hifive1-revB-hw]: https://www.crowdsupply.com/sifive/hifive1-rev-b

## [OpenTitan](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/boards/opentitan)

A new silicon root of trust, for details, please see the repository.

## [Arty e21](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/boards/arty_e21)

An FPGA-based platform with large I/O potential and a vast array of timers.
The board is a Arduino-compatible footprint, enabling additional expansion.

# Deprecated

These are boards previously supported by Tock. They may have been deprecated
because the manufacturer quit making them or there was no longer any active
developers interested in maintaining them. Generally, we willing to resurrect
a deprecated board if someone is willing to take ownership of the platform,
however please [reach out to us first](https://www.tockos.org/community/).

## nRF51-DK (deprecated)

> **Note:** Tock has largely deprecated efforts around the nrf51 in favor of
> the nRF52.

![NRF51 Development Kit](/assets/img/nrf51dk.jpg)

The [Nordic nRF Development
Kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF51-DK) is Nordic
Semiconductor's development board for the popular Blutooth Low Energy SoC, the
NRF51. Both imix and Hail include this chip in addition to the SAM4L.
